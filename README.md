To solve the given problem, we need to determine the type of sound wave generated by a spherical loudspeaker located at the center of a room with sound-absorbing walls.

Given information:
- The loudspeaker is spherical and centered at the origin of our coordinate system \((\vec{r} = 0)\).
- The radius of the sphere is \(R\).
- The pressure on the surface of the sphere oscillates according to \( p_0 \cos(\omega t) \).

We are instructed to use the following form for the wave function:
\[ \psi(\vec{r}, t) = \chi(|\vec{r}|, t) \]

### Solution:

1. **Determine the Spherical Wave Equation**:
   Since the problem involves spherical symmetry, the wave function \(\psi(\vec{r}, t)\) only depends on the radial distance \(r = |\vec{r}|\) and time \(t\). The general form of the wave equation in spherical coordinates (with spherical symmetry) is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \right) \chi(r, t) = 0
   \]

2. **Boundary Condition**:
   The pressure oscillation at the surface of the sphere (\(r = R\)) is given by:
   \[
   p(R, t) = p_0 \cos(\omega t)
   \]
   Since pressure is related to the wave function, we can assume:
   \[
   \chi(R, t) = p_0 \cos(\omega t)
   \]

3. **Solution to the Spherical Wave Equation**:
   The solution to the spherical wave equation for a time-harmonic source is:
   \[
   \chi(r, t) = \frac{A}{r} \cos\left( \omega t - kr \right)
   \]
   where \(A\) is an amplitude constant, \(k = \frac{\omega}{c}\) is the wave number, and \(c\) is the speed of sound.

4. **Applying Boundary Conditions**:
   At \(r = R\), we have:
   \[
   \chi(R, t) = \frac{A}{R} \cos\left( \omega t - kR \right) = p_0 \cos(\omega t)
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   \frac{A}{R} = p_0 \quad \text{and} \quad kR = 0 \Rightarrow k = \frac{\omega}{c}
   \]
   So, \(A = p_0 R\).

5. **Final Wave Function**:
   Substituting \(A\) back into the solution, we get:
   \[
   \chi(r, t) = \frac{p_0 R}{r} \cos\left( \omega t - \frac{\omega r}{c} \right)
   \]

Hence, the wave function describing the sound wave generated by the spherical loudspeaker is:
\[
\psi(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{p_0 R}{|\vec{r}|} \cos\left( \omega t - \frac{\omega |\vec{r}|}{c} \right)
\]

This describes a spherical sound wave emanating from the source at the center of the room, with amplitude decreasing as \(\frac{1}{r}\) and a phase shift corresponding to the distance traveled by the wave.
